Fill in the Blank 1: Bumpers and Buttons

This script will give you experience on the event mechanism
for the bumpers and buttons. You will also be able to engage
many of the robot's interactive features, like wheel movement,
lights, and sounds. 

TODO: Fill in the blanks below to implement the following 4 functions 
such that:
    - When the left bumper is pressed, the robot starts to spin counter-clockwise,
      and the ring light will turn on in solid cyan.
    - When the right bumper is pressed, the robot starts to spin clockwise,
      and the ring light will turn on in solid magenta.
    - When the (.) button is pressed, the robot will decrease its spinning speed by 2,
      and play the note C5.
    - When the (..) button is pressed, the robot will increase its spinning speed by 2,
      and play the note D5.

NOTE: When any bumper is pressed, the speed of rotation is reset to the default speed of 4.

To aid you in this assignment, all lines that need to be changed will be marked with (TODO) 
in a nearby comment.

We will use a variable called SPEED to store the current speed of the robot, and a variable
called ROTATION_DIR to track which direction the robot is moving. Since
we'll need to interact and change these variables across multiple functions in this script,
we must make SPEED and ROTATION_DIR GLOBAL variables.
